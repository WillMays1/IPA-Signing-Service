The following are possible error fixes.

Cannot connect to *yourwebsite* -> you are not pointing the html file to the correct .plist

Cannot download app at this time (pops up on homescreen then gives error) -> your .plist is not pointing to the correct .ipa or the ipa is not signed with the correct udid
